laundry mountain in bedroom is now critical somehow simultaneously have no clean socks and too many unmatched socks need to finally deal with that one load that's been in the dryer for who knows how long sheets need washing desperately but first need to figure out where the other set went might be in storage need to go through all the storage bins actually everything in storage needs sorting might find the missing tupperware lids should probably inventory all kitchen stuff while at it the spice cabinet is a disaster can't find anything anymore need to check expiration dates on everything in pantry too many half-empty bags of things need to consolidate and probably get better containers that weird smell in fridge needs investigating pretty sure it's from that container way in the back but too afraid to look also need to clean microwave and figure out what spilled in there last week or maybe last month pots and pans need reorganizing can never find the right lids should probably get a rack or something for better organization
